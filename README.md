# Feedback Form

_Duration: 48 hour sprint_

This app is a feedback form designed using React and Redux as well as SQL to contain responses. By entering a score in each category and then submitting it, the user can provide feedback on different areas of their day. This project is scalable to include additional areas if the client chooses to increase their data gathering.

## Built With
